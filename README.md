My name is Clinton Williams.  I have a wife and 3 children. I'm a full time beer and wine salesperson.  I've been studying web development for about 6 months.  I'm studying each day.  Sometimes a little bit in the morning and almost every evening.  I enjoy it.   If I can code and forget to eat I must like it right? lol

Currently I'm learning more about Git, Javascript and html/css.

Here are a couple projects that I have done so far!
